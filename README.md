# Knight's tour problem
In this project I am trying to solve the [knight's problem}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour). I do that by using a [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) to learn how neural network work. And I will do that by doing all from scratch. It is also a good exercise to learn modern C++.
